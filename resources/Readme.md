# UK GEMINI consolidated content on the AGI Website

Notes on articles, links, and publishing

Peter Parslow, revised 5 August 2021, to describe the Blue Star hosted AGI site

# Notes on publishing

Files have to be emailed to AGI &amp; Blue Star. Blue Star provide AGI an estimate for the cost of the update, and AGI then have to decide whether to go ahead.

## XML Dynamic content

Recommendation: for configuration control of the XML &amp; XSLT, use file names with dates in.

If you change the XML, regenerate the three pages:

- GEMINI\_YYYYMMDD.xsl with parameter &quot;gemini\_sv&quot; gives a new &quot;service&quot; page to go at [1063 Gemini Services - Association For Geographic Information (agi.org.uk)](https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1063-gemini-services/)
- GEMINI\_YYYYMMDD.xsl with parameter &quot;gemini\_dt&quot; gives a new &quot;dataset&quot; page to go at [1062 Gemini Datasets and Data Series - Association For Geographic Information (agi.org.uk)](https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1062-gemini-datasets-and-data-series/)
- Summary\_YYYYMMDD.xsl gives a new &quot;summary&quot; page to go at [1250-element-summary - Association For Geographic Information (agi.org.uk)](https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1250-element-summary/)

Update the &#39;change log&#39;: [1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0 - Association For Geographic Information (agi.org.uk)](https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/1055-uk-gemini-major-changes-since-1-0/)

## Static content

For small changes, a marked up (Word?) file seems to work. For larger changes, Blue Star appreciate a replacement HTML file. The way they insert that into their Content Management System handles styling – along with the GEMINI.css that would rarely need changing.

# Page list

The numeric part of each URL reflects the article number in the previous web host&#39;s Content Management System. The textual part of the URL reflects a rather old title of the article!

They all work on a stem of [https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/](https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/40-gemini/), with [https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/](https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/) redirecting to it (i.e. either stem will work).
